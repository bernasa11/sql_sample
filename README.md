I developed a project in which I applied the knowledge I acquired during a Data Analyst training course, making a case study of employability in Portugal with random data. I created the database and 2 reports: one in Excel and the other in Power BI.
In the database, the columns created were generic data such as age, gender, employment status, qualifications, etc. This data was generated in Excel, on a sample of 10,000 records, using functions such as RAND/RANDBETWEEN, DATE, XLOOKUP, INDEXMATCH, etc. 
That said, I created my dashboard in Excel.

Before extracting the data from Excel to Power BI, I started by processing the data, setting up my DIM and FCT tables and then working on PowerQuery in BI. After a few transformations, I defined the layout of my tables (star scheme) and started working on my dashboard. 
All the data I worked on I used DAX functions to create a variety of attractive visuals that were suitable for the user experience and analytics.
